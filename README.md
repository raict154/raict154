I love to use emoji :+1:

Hahaha I will type anything I need here :O
OMG, this really works
I'm starting to love Github

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]: OMG, I can't belive i'm learning Github
